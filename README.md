# asp.net-mvc-core-1.0-localized-routing

A working localized routing example for ASP.NET MVC Core 1.0 release candidate 1. The solution uses attributes on the controllers & actions to determine the localized routing for each different culture. A convention is added to the MvcOptions in startup.cs to iterate over all the controllers & actions to set their routes based on the localized attributes.
